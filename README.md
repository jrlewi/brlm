R package for implementing Bayesian restricted likelihood methods

This package is an attempt to consoladate the code I used in my dissertation research (Lewis, John R., 'Bayesian Restricted Likelihood Methods'. The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, 2014). In hind sight, I wish I would have worked on this package during graduate school - however, I was not as familar with R package development back then and so, like many students, I ended up with a bunch of source scripts. The goal is to make the scripts more sharable. 

As my career has taken me in other directions, I have had very little time to continue this line of research. I believe there are many directions future researchers could take and would be happy to share the repository if anyone is interested in code development - I admit the code and documentation could be improved in several areas. The documentation is written rather hastely (translating from comments in my source code to proper R documentation is no easy feat - one reason why I wish I did this in grad school!) and the code performance could be improved by re-writting in C++, for example. 

Please let me know if you are using the code and have any questions!

My Best,
John
