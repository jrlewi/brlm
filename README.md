R package for implementing Bayesian restricted likelihood methods

This package is an attempt to consolidate the code I used in my dissertation research (Lewis, John R., 'Bayesian Restricted Likelihood Methods'. The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, 2014 - available at https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1407505392&disposition=inline). A technical report with much of the work is also available on my co-advisor Yoon Lee's website http://www.stat.osu.edu/~yklee/mss/tr878.pdf and paper is forthcoming in ISBA's Bayesian Analysis. 
 
Please let me know if you are using the code and have any questions!
